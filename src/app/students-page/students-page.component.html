        <h2 class="uppercase">What can I expect by being a part of Blueprint?</h2>
        <div>
          At the very least, you can expect to make new friends, to be constantly challenged with new technical problems, and be a part of a tight-knit team that is making a difference.

      <div class="row">
        <h2 class="uppercase">I don't have a lot of experience in software development. Should I still apply?</h2>
        <div>
          Yes! Blueprint is a great way to gain more experience as a software developer. You will be surrounded by peers that are willing to help you at every step of the way. As a team, we care deeply about your ability to learn and your passion for social good -- less so about past experience.
